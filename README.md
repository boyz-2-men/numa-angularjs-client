# Numa AngularJS Client

## What?
"Numa" is derived from "pne√∫ma", meaning wind, breath, spirit. This is the repo for Numa's AngularJS client, a work in progress. Numa is becoming a hub for sharing poetry, musings, and free-form diction. It will be a platform to garner feedback and connect with others. A descendant of [Warrior Poets](https://github.com/trance-with-me/Warrior-Poets).

## Why?
I'm developing Numa because I care about connecting with people; sharing expressive works with my friends and family; and having a clean, dynamic, and modern web application for sharing any form of lyrical expression.

## Okay, how do I get the client running?
* Download and install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/). You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm
* Download and install [Node.js package manager](https://github.com/npm/npm).
* Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): `npm install -g grunt-cli` 
* Install [Bower](http://bower.io/): `npm install -g bower`
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/trance-with-me/numa-client.git`
* Install packages: `npm install`
